This dataset contains a collection of Twitter rumours and non-rumours posted during breaking news.


The data is structured as follows. Each event has a directory, with two subfolders, rumours and non-rumours. These two folders have folders named with a tweet ID. The tweet itself can be found on the 'source-tweet' directory of the tweet in question, and the directory 'reactions' has the set of tweets responding to that source tweet. Also each folder contains ‘annotation.json’ which contains information about veracity of the rumour and ‘structure.json’, which contains information about structure of the conversation.
